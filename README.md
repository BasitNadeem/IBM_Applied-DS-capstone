# SpaceX Dataset_IBM-Applied Data Science :fire:

This repo represents IBM Data Science SpaceX dataset Project. In this project, we gathered and analyzed SpaceX dataset which is a rocket manufacturing company. 

We did exploratory data analysis on SpaceX dataset and visualized our findings using location maps and different variables. Not only that, we also did make predictive machine learning models for predicting the future success rate of rockets.

We are trying to find answers for future successful landing of rocket stages with payload masses. So we train predictive machine learning models for predicting the success rate of rocket stage landings.

## Project Summary

Following procedures were followed during the project: 
- **Data Collection** 
  * Using SpaceX REST API 
  * Using webscrapping SpaceX wikipedia page 
- **Data Wrangling**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL** 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Data Visualization**
